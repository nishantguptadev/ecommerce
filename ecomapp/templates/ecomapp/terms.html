            </div>
            <div class="">
                <p class="">Any user of the public Network is welcome to participate in
                    community discussions, to answer questions, and to share their hard earned knowledge with public
                    Network community participants, provided that they comply with the obligations set forth in these
                    Public Network Terms, and to the extent that use of the public Network does not conflict with the
                    applicable laws, rules and regulations of the user’s jurisdiction. MyEko reserves the right
                    to refuse, suspend or terminate your access to the public Network if it determines, in its sole
                    discretion, that you have in any way violated these Public Network Terms or are otherwise ineligible
                    to access or use the Network or Services. If your actions are determined by us to violate these
                    Public Network Terms, MyEko may, in its sole discretion, try to remediate that violation by
                    working with you individually, but is under no obligation to do so, and if any such remediation
                    efforts are unsuccessful (in MyEko’s sole discretion), then MyEko may revoke your
                    rights to the Network. You are solely responsible for ensuring that these Public Network Terms are
                    in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to you, and the right to access the
                    Network or any Services is revoked where these Public Network Terms or use of the Network or any
                    Services is prohibited or conflicts with any applicable law, rule or regulation.</p>
                <p class="">MyEko will use reasonable efforts to make the public
                    Network available 24/7/365, but from time-to-time we will have scheduled outages for maintenance
                    purposes and other upkeep. Where feasible, we may, in our sole discretion, make efforts to inform
                    you about any outages and report on the nature and reason for any outages that may occur in an open
                    and transparent manner, though we are under no obligation to do so, and in any case will not be
                    liable for any downtime.</p>

                <h4 class="">a. Assignment and Jurisdiction</h4>
                <p class="">MyEko reserves the right to assign our rights and
                    obligations under these Public Network Terms (in whole or in part) without your consent to a
                    corporate affiliate, or in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate restructure or
                    reorganization, or due to the sale of all or substantially all of our assets.</p>
                <p class="">These Public Network Terms will be governed by and construed in
                    accordance with the applicable laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to the
                    principles of that State regarding conflicts of laws. Both you and MyEko hereby irrevocably
                    agree to the sole and exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Courts of the State of New York with
                    respect to any action, suit, or proceeding brought by it or against it by the other party in
                    connection with the Network or Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, these Public Network Terms
                    shall not prevent either party from seeking injunctive relief with respect to a violation of the
                    confidentiality provisions and indemnification provisions contained in these Public Network Terms.
                    The Uniform Commercial Code shall not apply to the provisions of these Public Network Terms to the
                    fullest extent permitted by law. No shrinkwrap or click-wrap terms contained in any purchase order
                    or any Company or Team form shall apply to or supersede these Public Network Terms. In the event of
                    any conflict between the terms and conditions of these Public Network Terms and any such shrinkwrap
                    or click-wrap terms, the terms and conditions of the former shall prevail.</p>

                <h4 class="">b. Mandatory Arbitration</h4>
                <p class="">YOU AGREE THAT WITH RESPECT TO ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND MyEko
                     OR ITS AFFILIATES OR ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, OR EMPLOYEES (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE
                    INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
                    DISPUTES RELATING TO THESE PUBLIC NETWORK TERMS, YOUR USE OF THE NETWORK OR SERVICES, AND/OR RIGHTS
                    OF PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY, YOU AND MyEko SHALL FIRST CONSULT WITH EACH OTHER TO ATTEMPT
                    TO RESOLVE SUCH DISPUTE IN A MANNER SATISFACTORY TO BOTH PARTIES, AND THAT IF A RESOLUTION IS NOT
                    REACHED WITHIN NINETY (90) DAYS, THEN THE DISPUTE SHALL BE REFERRED TO AND RESOLVED BY BINDING
                    ARBITRATION UNDER JAMS, INC.’S RULES FOR ARBITRATION OF CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES AND YOU AND WE
                    HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU HAVE IN ANY
                    MANNER VIOLATED OR THREATENED TO VIOLATE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, WE MAY SEEK INJUNCTIVE OR
                    OTHER APPROPRIATE RELIEF IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK. DISCOVERY AND
                    RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT
                    YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION. As an alternative, you may bring
                    your claim in your local “small claims” court, if permitted by that small claims court’s rules and
                    if within such court’s jurisdiction, unless such action is transferred, removed or appealed to a
                    different court. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor we will participate
                    in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement to arbitrate.
                    YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS
                    CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF
                    INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private or
                    representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account, if we are a
                    party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal
                    Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration. In the event JAMS, INC. is
                    unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the
                    case, then either we or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the American
                    Arbitration Association. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
                    court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator
                    will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Public Network
                    Terms. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action
                    arising out of, related to or connected with the use of the public Network or these Public Network
                    Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim of action arose or be forever banned.</p>
                <p class="">You agree that, notwithstanding anything in the foregoing, any
                    arbitration proceeding between you and us will be conducted in New York, NY, USA, that the language
                    of the arbitration shall be in English, and that all arbitration proceedings shall be considered
                    confidential in nature.</p>
                <p class="">If you don’t want to be bound by the arbitration and class-action
                    waiver provisions in this section, you must notify us in writing within thirty (30) days of the date
                    that you first accept these Public Network Terms (unless a longer period is required by applicable
                    law), and then you must litigate any disputes against us in accordance with the “Assignment and
                    Jurisdiction” section below. Your written notification must be mailed to us at MyEko, Attn:
                    Legal Department, 110 William Street, Floor 28, New York, NY 10038 or by email notification at team
                    (at) MyEko.com. If you do not notify us in accordance with this paragraph, you agree to be
                    bound by the terms of this section, including, without limitation, the arbitration and class-action
                    waiver provisions, and also including such provisions in any modifications we make to these Public
                    Network Terms after the date of your first acceptance. Such notification must include: (i) your
                    name; (ii) your email address and mailing address; and (iii) a statement that you do not wish to
                    resolve disputes with us through arbitration or waive your ability to participate in a class action.
                    If we make any changes to this section (other than a change to the address at which we will receive
                    notices or rejections of future changes to this section), you may reject any such change by sending
                    us written notice, within thirty (30) days of the change, to the address set out in the “Notices”
                    section. It is not necessary to send us a rejection of a future change to this section if you had
                    properly opted out within the first thirty (30) days after you first accepted the provisions in this
                    section. If you have not properly opted out, then by rejecting a future change, you are agreeing
                    that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this section, as
                    modified by any changes you did not reject. A notification sent pursuant to this paragraph solely
                    affects these Public Network Terms; if you previously entered into other arbitration or dispute
                    resolution agreements with us or enter into other such agreements in the future, your notification
                    that you are opting out of the provisions in this section shall not affect the other arbitration
                    agreements between you and us.</p>
